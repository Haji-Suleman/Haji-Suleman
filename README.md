# Hi, I’m Haji Suleman 👋  
🚀 AI Systems Engineer in Training | Backend Architect | Mathematical Computing  

I build **scalable backend systems** and integrate **machine learning models** grounded in strong mathematical foundations.  
My focus lies at the intersection of **deep learning, optimization, and production-grade engineering**.

> I approach software and AI with mathematical rigor, algorithmic clarity, and architectural discipline.
